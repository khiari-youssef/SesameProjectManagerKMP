# Sesaworks
A mobile app for Sesame university students to manage their academic projets.
## Purpose
This app is built as part of my academic projects but also serves as a sample for a jetpack-compose android app.
As you inspect the code, you will notice that it is a Kotlin multiplatform app but i decided to go android-first because i had issues with compose multiplatform and sqldelight.
* What does this app showcase ?
 - Creating modular and reusable UI components jetpack compose (Implementing a design system built on top of M3)
 - State management with jetpack compose.
 - MVVM architectural design pattern.
 - The power of Kotlin's asynchronous and reactive programming using Coroutines and flows.
 - Clean architecture 
 - Testing with Junit and compose UI testing API
 - Storing and fetching data from local database using SQlDelight.
 - Making API calls using Ktor Http client.
 - Implementation of a biometric authentication with jetpack compose.
